Is not objectively better than newer cameras but feels subjectively better. Comes close to film dslr. You will love or hate it in 2022.",

You can even face it forward so you can see yourself while shooting. You can also rotated it against the body in the closed position to protect the screen.",

        "review": " This isn't a deal breaker, but Nikon offers several color profiles that you can upload to your camera. For example, I used to shoot with Velvia film on my F3 because I loved the color saturation. I can download the Velvia color profile and upload it to my camera under Shooting Menu>Manage Picture Control. The D3500 gives you seven onboard picture controls that you can manually adjust, but doesn't allow you upload additional color profiles",

It will help you to become a better photographer, you're forced to move around and you will notice how much deeper the colors are and the more bokeh you can get. It's a steal and it needs to be in your collection. Just remember to use different lenses for different occasions, if you're into landscapes, this lens won't do the job but tight images and portraits, its gonna be your go to",
